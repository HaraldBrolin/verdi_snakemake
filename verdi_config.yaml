# trunc-len-f
#   Position at which forward read sequences should be truncated.
#   This truncates the 3' end of the of the input sequences,
#   reads that are shorter than this value will be discarded. After this
#   parameter is applied there must still be at least a 20 nucleotide overlap
#   between the forward and reverse reads. If 0 is provided, no truncation or
#   length filtering will be performed.

# trim-left-f (Should not be done for 16S)
#   Position at which forward read sequences should be trimmed.
#   This trims the 5' end of the input sequences, which will be
#   the bases that were sequenced in the first cycles.

# The same settings exist for reverse reads, trunc-len-r and trim-left-r
